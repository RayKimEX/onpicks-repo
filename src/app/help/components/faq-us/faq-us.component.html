    How does import and customs work?
  </div>
  <p class="body-2-regular">If an aircraft arrives in Korea on the same date even if the order is made by Onpicks on another day, it will be treated as a combined tax and a customs/value added tax will occur.
    For additional orders, it is recommended that you confirm that your existing order has arrived in Korea.
    In addition, if items purchased through other shopping malls arrive in Korea on the same date as items purchased from Onpicks, there may be duties and taxes.
    Taxes levied at customs in the importer are not related to Onpicks, but are separate from shipping charges paid to Onpicks.
    Onpicks shall not be liable for any tax consequences or refusal caused by custommer’s failure to check in advance.
    Depending on the importing country the ingredients available for the food and medicines may vary, and may require separate import-related documents or doctor prescriptions.
    Please check the customs clearance of the product you are trying to purchase before ordering it at the Korea Customs Service (www.customs.go.kr) and the ingredients of the product through the Food and Drug Safety Ministry(www.kfda.go.kr)
